<b> Hi, I'm Ruben and I am a full stack developer.</b> I just graduated from Microverse, a full-time remote web development program, after seven months where I  created amazing projects using best programming practices, soft skills like cross-cultural communication, creativity to solve problems, writing skills, working through conflict, time management, and pair programming with international students. Before joining Microverse, I worked in a financial banking company in Peru as a full stack developer, designing and developing multiple microservices for accounting reports processing millions of records, identified potential improvements, and developed software automation. I also developed some other freelance projects for local companies designing websites and built some web applications.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can keep growing my programming skills in the EdTech space and I'd love to keep in touch. Do you have a LinkedIn or an AngelList profile you can share so we can connect there?‚Äù
